⭕VPC
• It is simply a data-center inside AWS for one client. 
• One region can have 5 VPC and each VPC can have 200 subnets. 
• CIDR of VPC can't be changed once created.
• Public VPCs are the ones who connected to the internet gateway & their route is defined in the routing table for internet. Instances in an Public VPCs should also have public or Elastic IP to connect to the VPC.
• Private subnets can't be accessed through internet. We can have our own custom CIDR in private VPC between 10.0.0.0/16 to 10.0.0.0/24.
• Creation if VPC is as follows: 
Create VPC => Create Subnet => Create IG => define routing table
• First 4 IPs and last 1 IP of CIDR is reserved. AWS do not support broadcast but still reserved last IP.


⭕Router
• It is connected to VPC & it connects resources in AZs and also connects the VPC to the Internet Gateway
• 200 route tables per VPC, one route table can have 50 routes.
• A Subnet can't be associated with multiple route table, but one multiple subnets can be associated with same route table.


⭕Internet Gateway
• IG is a virtual router


⭕NAT Gateway
• Enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet but prevent internet from connecting to the instances.
• It is always attached to public subnet.
• It is neccessary to specify Elastic IP and Public subnet for NAT.
• Need to assign public IP address to private instance.
• Terribly expensive.


⭕Security Groups
• It is a virtual firewall that is applied on subnet level as well as  on the individual instance.
• Can make 5 SGs for one EC2.
• Can only permit rules not deny.
• If some port is allowed then traffic can come from internet as well as sent from the instance, i.e inbound rules are automatically copied for outbound rules.


⭕NACL
• Optional layer for additional security to the VPC which acts as firewall for contrlling traffic in and out of subnets.


⭕VPC Peering
• Two VPC can communicate with each other using private IPv4 address.
• Transitive peering is not possible.


⭕VPC Endpoint
• It is virtual device & less expensive than NAT Gateway.

â­•Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):
â€¢ Provides scalable computing in cloud eliminating the need of the hardware.
â€¢ Handles scaling up or down as per requirement.
â€¢ Has 2 storage options EBS & instance store.
â€¢ One region can have 20 EC2 instances, request amazon for more.



â­•Types Of Instances:
ðŸŸ¢General Purpose
â€¢ Average configuration, has balance of computing
â€¢ Used for variety of workloads
â€¢ Has 3 series, A, M and T
  Â° A-instances are used for scale out workloads and well suited for           microservices, webserver, etc.
  Â° Some M-instances provides 2 to 96 CPUs & 8 to 384 GBs of RAM
  Â° T-instances are baseline level of CPU performances, low performance.
â€¢ Has 2 to 8 CPUs and 0.5 to 32 GBs of RAM.

ðŸŸ¢Compute Optimised
â€¢ Has a server that can do multiple or batch processing.
â€¢ Has only C series having types like C4, C5 and C5n.

ðŸŸ¢Memory Optimized
â€¢ Designed to work for huge data processing and manage huge database
â€¢ Has 3 series, R, X and Z.
â€¢ Instances in R series can have upto 768 Gbs of RAM, 96 CPUs.
â€¢ X series have min 122 to 3904 GBs of RAM & upto 128 CPUs.
â€¢ Z series have high frequency 4.0 ghz fastest as of now.

ðŸŸ¢Storage Optimised
â€¢ Has series of I, D and H.
â€¢ Designed for high and seqential read and write to very large data sets on local storage. eg: songspk.com, youtube.com.
â€¢ Has low latency & supports tens of thousands I/O operation per second
â€¢ I series can be used for online transactions.

ðŸŸ¢High Memory
â€¢ It is for dedicated host so we have to purchase one minimum for 3 years. Installed directly on the hardware. No VM.
â€¢ Designed to run large in-memory databases.
â€¢ Has U series.
â€¢ Has RAM 6, 9, 12TB



â­•Purchasing Options:
â€¢ There are purchasign options like On Demand, Dedicated Instance, Dedicated Host, Spot Instance, Schedule and Reserved Instance.
â€¢ But there are only majorly 3 ways to pay i.e On Demand, Reserved and Spot instance


â­•EC2 Access:
â€¢ To access instances we need key and key pair name. We can download this private key only once.
â€¢ Public key is saved by AWS to match to key pair name.
â€¢ Even if the EC2 is stopped the EBS is attached i.e its storage will cost billing even after instance is terminated.
â€¢ Instance can retain private IPV4, IPV6 and Elastic IP.
â€¢ Public IP gets removed when instance is closed.


â­•EBS vs Instace Storage
â€¢ EBS is easily replicated with AZs
â€¢ EBS volumes attached at launch are deleted when instance is terminated if deletion protection is disabled.
â€¢ EBS volumes attached at running instance will not be deleted when EBS is detached from instance
â€¢ EBS is network attach storage
â€¢ Instance Store is directly attached to instance and is faster than EBS
â€¢ Data is not lost when OS is rebooted, but it does on termination, drive failure.
â€¢ Can't detach or attach another, not for valuable long term data

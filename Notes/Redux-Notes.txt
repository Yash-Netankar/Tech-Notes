ðŸŸ¢ Intro
â€¢ It is a container that stores all the data
â€¢ Used to make effective communication between multiple components
â€¢ Context is the alternative but we might need to create multiple contexts in big projects whereas redux can manage all in one store
â€¢ Redux store contains all the data and this store is separated from the main project thus we can access this store's data from anywhere
â€¢ Data flow is always unidirectional which means data will go from actions to reducers to store and then finally in components.
â€¢ Actions Reducers Store & View are four main pillars of redux
â€¢ Better to have only one store in one application.

ðŸŸ¢ Actions
â€¢ It receives data and later that data is sent to the reducers along with the type of the action.
â€¢ Action type could be anything like increment, decrement, add to cart, remove from cart, etc

ðŸŸ¢ Reducers
â€¢ Reducers perform the operations on data we get from the actions.
